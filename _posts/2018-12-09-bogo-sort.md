# Bogo Sort Algorithm

In computer science, bogosort[1][2] (also known as permutation sort, stupid sort,[3] slowsort,[4] shotgun sort or monkey sort) is a highly ineffective sorting function based on the generate and test paradigm. The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.
