`jekyls,l new <PATH>` installs a new Jekyll site at the path specified (relative to current directory). In this case, 이슈이슈 gem use `jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle`.)
- By default, the Jekyll site installed by `jekyll new` uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.
- We recommend setting up Jekyll with a gem-based theme but if you want to start with a blank slate, use `jekyll new myblog --blank`
- To learn about other parameters you can include with `jekyll new`, type `jekyll new --help`.
